# 🔗 CLI URL Shortener

A simple, command-line based URL shortener written in Python. This project allows you to generate short codes for long URLs and retrieve them later — all stored locally in a JSON file.

File Structure:

url-shortener/
├── shortener.py      # Core logic (shorten/expand)
├── app.py            # CLI interface
├── data.json         # Stores URL mappings
├── programexec       # image displaying an example case
├── README.md         # You're reading it!

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a computer engineering student, I wanted to work on a small, practical project that would help me:

- Improve my Python fundamentals
- Understand how basic URL shortening logic works
- Learn about hashing concepts (generating unique identifiers)
- Gain more confidence in building and structuring CLI tools

This was also a quick way to sharpen my skills while keeping the project small enough to complete in a day and upload to GitHub.

- Automatically detects and avoids duplicate entries
